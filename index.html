			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>
				I am a passionate computer enthusiast with a fervor for technology and a heart dedicated to exceptional customer service. As a recent graduate, I've spent my academic journey immersed in the dynamic world of Year Up and Chick-fil-A, where I've honed my troubleshooting skills and provided 2nd-mile service to customers.
			
				In my role as an intern, I became adept at understanding and addressing customer needs, enhancing their overall experience. My commitment to customer satisfaction and effective communication has not only contributed to my team's success but has also earned me a reputation for creating roaring fans.
        	  	
				Beyond the professional realm, I find joy in two main pursuits â€“ video games and the culinary arts. The challenges of gaming fuel my fascination with technology, engaging my critical thinking skills, while cooking allows me to craft both delicious meals and a healthy lifestyle.
        	      		 
				I am on the precipice of an exciting transition into the corporate environment, where I aim to leverage my customer service skills and troubleshooting knowledge. The fast-paced culture of technology captivates me, and I see it as a platform to expand my horizons in a professional setting.
						
				Dedication, adaptability, and an insatiable desire to learn are at the core of my strengths. I've been actively pursuing IT fundamentals, exploring help-desk software, and expanding my customer service skills through online courses, all in preparation for a tech support role.
			
				My journey is leading me towards a career in desktop support, where I can combine my passion for technology with my innate ability to connect with and assist people. I am excited about the potential of technology to make a meaningful difference in people's lives.
			
				I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share a passion for technology, customer service, and the potential of these realms to bring about positive change. Let's connect, collaborate, and explore the exciting intersection of technology and customer engagement!

			<h2> What I am working on right now? </h2>
